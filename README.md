## Branching Strategy
The branching strategy for each project repository will be as follows:

- **main branch:** This branch contains the stable and production-ready code. All new features and fixes are merged into this branch after thorough testing.
- **feature branches:** These branches are used for developing new features.
- **bugfix branches:** These branches are used for fixing bugs in the codebase
- **release branches:** These branches are used for preparing a new production release.

## .gitignore Usage
The `.gitignore` file is used to exclude files and directories that do not need to be tracked by Git. This helps keep the repository clean and reduces unnecessary clutter. Common entries in the `.gitignore` file include:

- **Build files:** Compiled code, such as `.dll` and `.exe` files.
- **Environment files:** Files containing environment-specific settings, such as `.env` files.
- **Log files:** Application logs and debug logs.
- **Dependency directories:** Directories used by package managers, such as `node_modules` for Node.js projects.
